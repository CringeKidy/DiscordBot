## Mealk Discord Bot

## Thanks for looking at my bot

i hope to add a lot more to this bot like Rhythm features EG: !play, !skip etc while also having a dashboard like mee6 but for now i am just doing what i can do

## What can i do now

Well not much really cause this is a learning project for me as well as trying to get something out of it but here are some things that you can do if you would like

 * add the bot to your discord: Invite to Server

* follow my twitch cause i normally stream me making the bot on there: Twitch

* follow my instagram to keep updated sorta Instagram

## Bug reports
well sorry if you have bugs but to report them there are 2 things you can do you can:

1.join my discord server and leave a report in bot-bugreports: My Discord Server invite

you can leave an issue report here on the repo Issues

## Other things
if you have any questions please dont be afaird to ask and if you want to start your own bot i would recommend this site: An Idiots Guide
