# Mealk Discord Bot

## Thanks for looking at my bot
i hope to add a lot more to this bot like Rhythm features EG: !play, !skip etc while also having a dashboard like mee6 but for now i am just doing what i can do

## What can i do now 
Well not much really cause this is a learning project for me as well as trying to get something out of it but here are some things that you can do if you would like
1. add the bot to your discord:
  [Invite to Server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=700150917181210745&permissions=8&scope=bot)
  
2. follow my twitch cause i normally stream me making the bot on there:
  [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cringekidy)
  
3. follow my instagram to keep updated sorta

1.join my discord server and leave a report in bot-bugreports:

2.you can leave an issue report here on the repo
